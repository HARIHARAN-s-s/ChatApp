# ChatApp

# ðŸ“š MCU Communication & Porting Project â€” Week 1

## âœ… Objective

The objective of Week 1 is to build a **UDP Chat Application** in C that demonstrates key concepts such as:

- OSI Layer mapping to real protocols
- Core C programming constructs
- Data structures: Circular Buffer, Queue, Linked List
- State Machine logic
- Multi-threading using POSIX threads
- Event-driven message processing

This task solidifies foundational embedded and network programming skills in a Linux environment.

## ðŸ§  Key Topics Covered

- OSI Model Mapping (with UDP stack)
- State Machines and Events
- Arrays and Pointers
- RTOS vs Superloop (theoretical comparison)
- Scheduler and Thread usage
- Data Structures:
  - Queue (Linked List)
  - Circular Buffer
- Pointers:
  - Structure Pointers
  - Function Pointers & Callback Functions
- Bitwise Operations and Byte Packing
